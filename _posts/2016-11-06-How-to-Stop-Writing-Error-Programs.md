The dark side of the programming is very powerful. This wont allow you to write the program which is free from the **ERRORS.**

#### **MOOD to CODE**

> MOOD is the state of feeling which helps in creation and destruction.

Calling yourself a programmer is not a good thing , unless you write the program that works first time itself. When you are in the mood of upset, close the laptop and move to the place where you feel like you are the best only left in this world, spend little bit of time and just stop thinking about thinking of solutions to the existent problems which results in the raise of new problem, eventually leads to error code.

#### **CODE-CHILDREN-TIME**

> The actions of children, keeps you away from the stress.

The best part of human is your childhood. The childhood is the time where you never plan what to do. Planning is good , but plan to planning is not good. There will be the time of feeling distressed due to some irrelevant moments that you encountered in your daily activities, which results to the bad code or the code that value for nothing . That moment is the right time to do the things in the wrong time. You have to overcome this no matter it costs. So, immediately checkout the place to children and observe their movements, immediately you feel light and you will breath normally unlike you breath a second before.

#### **Walk Before You CODE**

> Coding is like walking on water

The more you walk, the more you code. You won’t believe this.** Don’t sit like a rock,keep moving like waves in the sea. **When struck with logic to be figured out, you immediately get off the place and walk a while thinking only about the logic, you won't believe that ,this helps in tracing out many paths to walk through over that logic to implement with right reflective solution. When you sit and you will stick. So, walk to make.

#### To CODE with LOVE

> When you love, you care

The boundary less Love makes you to do things with more responsibility. You will be possessive over the one whom you love and care. The love principle applies to the every programmer left on the earth. No matter it costs, you have to love your code. The code will be as hard and as beautiful as your loved one. Treat your coding lines with much respect, you will be given in return the fruit you haven’t tasted yet. Please do not stop loving your code and respecting the lines of code** (LOC) **you write.

#### Read before CODE

> Reading makes you to be yourself.

Yes, the programmer must read more. The thirst of brain is thinking. You have been surrounded by lot things which keeps you away from thinking. So read more to imagine and to think. Judge yourself when you walk over the book. Each letter you read is counted in building the strength of the mind, which is helpful to get creative ideas.

#### Game and CODE

> Games increase the mental strength.

Gaming is one of the most common habits of a programmer. The gamer put a lot of effort in writing the more consistency code. The gamer is the one who takes the right decisions in right time even the time that do not favor him. The gamer mind is filled with multidimensional ways of thinking matter. The gamer matters nothing more than the correct and reliable code. So play video games to write the hard code programs.
