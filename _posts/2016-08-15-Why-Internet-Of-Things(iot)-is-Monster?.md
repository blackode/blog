Engineers salad is IOT.

The up coming concept which consumes creative minds is the **IOT*** *which stands for *Internet Of Things*.

IOT is not as easy of talking or giving seminar on it.It is such a gigantic and massive technical term .But, IOT is still a stranger to developers and programmers.

### Novice:

These are the people who do not know what the IOT is? But, when we chant about Internet of things, they catch the word Internet and try to give some jest .The jest is really funny.This is what they say **“ Connecting things through Internet is IOT ”. **The definition of IOT is really such a small thing ,or people made it short for their convenience .IOT is not just connecting things through INTERNET it something beyond that.If that is the case then why no body is connecting them to INTERNET nor even not say how to connect.

### Misunderstand:

Many of us are misunderstanding for real IOT. Every one is thinking about how to get the data from the device and to computer. IOT is not the Data Analysis ,but Data analysis is very minute part of the IOT. Data Analysis the key object of the Internet of things but getting the data where data seems to be extinct but still exists in the hidden mode. This is the place where IOT comes .

- *IOT is not Data Analysis*
- *IOT is not Connecting Media*
- *IOT is not Smart Homes*
- *IOT is not Smart Cities*
- *IOT is not What You See Outside*
- *IOT is not blinking LED*
- *IOT is not programming sensors*
- *IOT is not Micro Controller Programming*
- *IOT is not the book to read and learn*
- IOT is not alone
- IOT is not the just firmware
- IOT is not the simple Hardware
- IOT is not the Internet of Things
- IOT is not what I am Saying

So limit the IOT for certain things like locking doors automatic

Until or unless you burn your hands on your own ,you come to know the real IOT.

### Sensible :

#### The bug is not insect here

IOT is more sensible to the programmers . They cannot hold it tight nor leave it loose. They have to be intellectual about the attackers. They have to sleep with one eye opened to watch for any attacker entry into our world with out permission. The Cyber Security in IOT is must, because IOT has less resistance power. You can attack ,I can attack ,any one can attack. Hey I am just kidding. Hacking is not as easy I am talking. Even though IOT can be attacked, if once the security wall is build it can hold its strength until your protocol is broken.

Making and protecting are two sides of IOT coin. If Both are super imposed on one another then the result has a value or else it will be like honey with no sweet.

### No Standards:

**we need platform to stand**

IOT is not yet standardized . It is just like monarchy until unless we bring them to the common platform , we cannot see the revolution in IOT. The standards are harder than mountain. If Every one walks we get the path, but IOT is not quite opposite if everything is standard we get more developers (walkers)

### **Confusion:**

The great confusion of IOT which I have faced is, should I write the firmware according to the hardware exiting or else making the hardware according to the firmware. These are the possible ways of getting confused in usual states of mind. Both seems to be best, but this where the problem comes. Each part of development has its own advantage and disadvantage too.

### **No Developers:**

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/0*fq3swDYaxaQl_-Tl.)

IOT is like slow and steady win the race. But, our programmers are fast .IOT is back because of heavy need of developers. Every one knew this, but very few takes their turn towards IOT. We can see many programmers are in web Designing which is easy to learn and implement which is quite opposite to IOT .

IOT is very poor at development due to scarcity in developers. The programmer who does coding for fast results or out comes will choose the Web Designing and the programmer who does the coding slowly but looks for best results will move his or her eyes towards IOT.

The Programmers are not showing interest in IOT. They do not know that ,IOT is real Engineering. Once if you step in, no chance of giving up or quit. Sure you will taste the real engineering.

### **IOT Producers(Investors):**

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/0*1043GPucTEz9y2mJ.)

Many Producers are in the side of e-market. They always keeps funding the e-market. If some one goes with IOT idea, the bigger task is to make the producers to understand first what the IOT is and later we can talk about the funding. But, very rare the investors are showing interest in IOT. Even to make working demo of their idea. IOT needs a lot of eggs. To get the outcome in IOT, there should be a big crew behind this. This is the major thing where many ideas fall into trash. Really many ideas are worth but they are thrown in the trash. Even the diamonds are in dust before they turn into them.

> **No Cash Iot Crash**

The way of thinking in producers has to be changed from money to master piece. If the Producers really come with interest in IOT, it is no harder to make our IOT tree to give fruits. The break down of product is more easy when we had a great support. The ease of IOT has become flaw less.

**This is how the people look at you when you talk or come with an idea of IOT**

People are always interesting. I do not know how these guys turn like that. They had a great following. When they find something unique, they consider that as not part of the world. But when they had great use of it, they keep thinking about the origin of it.

**Any way please stop staring at me .I never come with an idea again…**
