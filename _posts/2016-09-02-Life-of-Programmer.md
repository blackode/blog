Don/t show bugs to him.

No Bug No code

The programmers are gift of the world.They are the most dangerous and most useful creatures with two fascinating features in the universe creation and destruction .How ever programmer is also a human who does having the desires of his own mind wish.The most dearest friend of the programmer is **the BUG**.Bug is not an insect here.

### Involuntary Actions:

Programmers do things that are not under their control at the time of programming.Even their mind got trained in such manner that it can give orders to him what to do.Some of them are

**Eat well Code Well**

- Eating nuts ,pea nuts ,ground nuts etc..he keeps eating with out having any knowledge on why he is eating ,even he cannot remember how much he has eaten.When he finds that bowl is empty then he comes out of that trans.Then he searches for some more,he never stops eating .
- His ears stops working at the time of programming.Some times unless you shout loudly or call him manually touching him he cannot acknowledge you.
- Drinking coffee or tea ,you know most of programmers prefer drinking tea or coffee when they deal with larger projects .
- full control on his mind..even the world ends he don’t bother.He keeps programming.
- Programmers never get dreams because they do not like the sleeping.
- They are most hatred people in society because they never talks to others .They like being alone.

### Time Eater:

> Time and code are directly proportional

Programmers eat the time with coding lines and bugs.The hardest time that they could eat is at the time which is near to deal line.

ANT EATER

ANT EATER

Programmers eat time like how the Ant Eater eats ants.The possible way of saving time is being the programmer.A Programmer never wants to miss a second in his life.To them time is bread.If some one asks him the what the time is then the fastest reply might be is the 10 min to solve this.Solving what?To him solving is clearing the bugs.

Programmers never come in time ,but they do in time.Programmers keep waiting their loved ones but not their clients.

### Love:

To the programmer love is the four bit string that can be stored in the character array of length 4.The most pity thing of a person is “being the lover of programmer” and expecting the time from him/her.Happiest thing is if both lovers are programmers.

### Mad Man:

Programmers are Great Thinkers Because they are mad

Programmers are Great Thinkers Because they are mad

The programmers some time look like the mad people .The mad people never bother about others .In the same manner the programmers keep thinking by forgetting the world.They travel millions of miles in their brain in-order to come out with the best that would possible.

### The Free Lancing Programmer:

*We call this programmers as Tie less programmers*. This kind of programmers work at home.They can work from any where at any time.These programmers mostly prefer to work at nights than days.The bedroom ,hall,kitchen every place is their working environment.They can code by sitting ,standing,dancing,what not everything.They had more freedom to work.

The other side of these programmers is they work for more hours than usual programmers.Their mind is full of tensions on whether they could submit the work in time or not.They are more busy than any one.They cannot enjoy while others enjoying.

### Office Programmer.

These programmers hold more patience than any one else.The hardest part of the life is waiting.The first thing that runs in their’s mind is “**going to office in time and neat**”. At the time they enter into office look like fresh fruits,but when they come out of the office they look like fruits with no juice because already inside the office somebody has drunken his juice and left him with peal.

### Holidays:

> To Programmers holidays are like programming grounds

Holidays are the most dangerous ones in programmers life.A programmer thinks more hours than usual during holidays .He gets more time to think how to create or destroy something .A programmer laughs with no reasons .His deeds are some how different to common people.During holidays his mind runs on the how to program than how to spend his holidays .

People enjoy during holidays but programmers too enjoy but quite different from others.He finds joy in programming.His eyes always looks for either a mobile or laptop screen.His mind got trained in the way that even at the most disturbance place he can think on his own.

### Who Hates the programmers more?

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/0*98Ent-pAcGpYnKSm.png)

Oh !! my GOD…

> *The ***Enter*** key and ***Backspace*** key*

When the programmer gets frustration the first thing he does is hitting the **Enter** key very hard continuously .When he is tired of editing he feels hating the **Backspace**.He has to do this millions of times in a project while clearing the bugs .

> **Themselves**

The next big haters of programmers are themselves.They keep hitting themselves either when their code works or don’t works.We can see the same reaction in hands but different expression.

> **The Coding chair**

The programmer emotions are shared by this chair .It keeps him to work in different angles. He will sleep in chair ,eat in chair,code in chair.. The chair holds the great touch of the programmer than his wife if he got married.

### What the programmers think when they are one minute before Death?

- I forgot to keep **; semicolon — C or C++ programmers**
- I forgot to **import -Java programmers**
- I forgot to load **JavaScript** file -Front End Programmers
- I forgot to closing <?php — ?> -php programmers
- etc ..I missed some programmers if you guys belong to that category just comment it
