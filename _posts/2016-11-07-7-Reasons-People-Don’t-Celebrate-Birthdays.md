#### 1. Who Cares

The mentality of this kinda is wrapped with high contrast pride, which helps them to walk on thorns without having foot guards. **These guys hypnotized by themselves to be like how they like to be**. They lay their own roads to build their path and walk on. They seems to be little obsessive (all consuming,dominating,controlling) , but they are the ones who do not pretend. They do not settle down easily, and they do not rest.

To them Birthdays are like normal days in a week. They do not like to waste one day to think how to celebrate, another day to do the preparations and one more day to execute the plan. They do not like the blowing off candles , They want to enlighten them by adding more wax(knowledge).

#### 2. Money-Time

These guys love the **Time **so, they care about the **Money**. If you think in practical, celebrating **Birthdays** means , It is just like doing favor for the people who are nothing to you with your **hard work**(money). For Three hours of pleasure we waste three days of our time which eventually results in wasting your money.

They look like a **miser **but they are not. They are the people who knows the values of money and they know where to spend love and care , you already know what I mean by the words love and care stands for. They value for the values and care for the cares.

#### 3. Fear

Simple but truth **“another year closer to death”**** perfect.**

#### 4. 29 th Year(age fear)

They do not want to expose themselves that they are **30** now. But it is actually the first anniversary of 29 th year. How stylish to say this insted of saying that I am **30** now.

#### **5. Am I Specia**l?

These people need the reasons for everything. They always think before they step in. If they feel of doing one thing the look around 360 degrees . They are mentally disordered ones, I mean they uncommon from common ones. **Celebrations need Victories.** They think that they haven’t done anything special yet ,so they stand far from the celebrations.

#### **6. I don’t like it.**

Some people who feel that they are unique but in real they do not, if you ask them **why you don’t celebrate Birthdays**, with no surprise they reply you with the heading of the paragraph and you can find the their body language to be something special they are while giving you the answer. They act more to pretend that they do not like birthdays.

If you **ask them why you do not like birthdays** means , please do not ask them nothing you get in return. They live in the feeling of ‘others thinking that these guys are unique by being like this’, so they maintain that nature. Let them live in that feeling at least that saves time and money in together.

#### 7. I know Truth

These Guys look for truth.They do not follow blindly.

We all know that , time never returns then how can I say that today is my birthday. If today is my birthday then the statement time never returns is false, if one has to celebrate the birthday means he has to do that on the day he took the first breath independently I mean the moment you were real born. That is the only day you were born not on day of the every year. That is loop hole. **There is no “Today is my Birthday” only “Today was my birthday”.**
