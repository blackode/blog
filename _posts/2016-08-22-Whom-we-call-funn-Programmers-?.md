Coding is fun when you love it.

> The code with out bugs is **not** considered to be good code

### Bond Between Code and Programmer

A Programmer is seriously coding by sitting in a chair facing the screen keeping his legs forward and his hands on key board ..suddenly he sees the command **press any key ,** then immediately he search for **any key** in the key board and he founds nothing so he press enter with frustration.

### Park programmers

Programmers always search for the pleasant climate to code.We can see the programmers sitting on a bench in park and keeps coding .Even though their laptop is getting heat ,they still bear with patience .Suddenly his phone gets vibrate with a call ,as the place being the park his mind immediately thinks of some insect crawling on his legs , so he will through the laptop up and jump like a frog .**The environment created the creatures in his mind.**

### Victims of Ctrl+S

Ctrl+S saves the life of programmer

There are two types in this category .Who press the **ctrl+s** with out any reason and who never press ctrl+s.No sooner he opens the editor ,he keeps typing **ctrl +s **with no reasons .With out his knowledge his hand fingers follow the flow of **ctrl+s **.The other type programmers are one keep on coding until his battery gets off then immediately he realize saving the code.Some times he loss the code if his lap shuts unnoticed.Again he starts typing the code then to his dismay,the power line gets cut again he realizes that he hasn’t save the code .

### Dining programmers

The programmer gets time to eat and in that time he gets a call to clear one small bug,so he gets his laptop on to the dining table then he starts the battle with left hand typing or single hand typing .He does all typing the code in parallel to eating suddenly his wife or children drip the glass down on the table ,he gets no time to take off the lap before the lap swim in the water.Immediate action after watering his laptop on dinging table is taking the cloth on the chair next to his chair and he starts rubbing ,to his dismay the towel is full of dust, his wife forgot to get rid off the dust from the towel after cleaning the table and misplaced it on the chair as commonly.

### 24/7 Programmers

Born for coding

These guys are **robots**.They are passionates with coding They do not have the specific time in their mind.They sleep in odd hours.Even they do not know he is getting sleep or she is sleeping at the time he is going on .They sleep on key board whole night ,in morning when he or she gets up and found the stamps of the keys on the cheeks.They eat while coding ,they drink while coding ,they do everything in parallel to coding or programming .Even if he sleep besides his wife he start typing on her body like marching ants carrying food to their home .Their eyes add the color red and looks very funny monster .Even the children afraid of these guys some times. **But they had passion and they are best lovers of coding.**

> Beyond all this the most funny incident in the life of a programmer is he is getting time to get married,and fortunate thing is getting partner also a programmer.

### Clever Bugs

The most annoying moment in the life of a programmer is coding to patch one bug and carrying extra bugs along.At the moment he, the programmer do not know weather to be happy for clearing the one bug or sad for getting some more bugs to crawl on his code.How ever bugs and code are relatives.They always exists together whatever you do.

This is completely fun side of the programmers ….. share your fun situation as a comment.
