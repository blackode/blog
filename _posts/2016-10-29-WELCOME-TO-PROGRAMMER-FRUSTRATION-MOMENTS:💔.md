### WELCOME TO PROGRAMMER FRUSTRATION MOMENTS:💔

> *All the following quoted paragraphs are observations from the real life of a programmer , I am the self witness . Every situation , I explained below happened in my life after becoming a programmer …….. 👣*

### Pressing Enter 🔑

This is the very common situation that every programmer should encounter and welcome with honor. No matters what the situation is you keep on coding and you need to build the code you have been written with the aim of no errors ,unexpectedly you met with surprising welcome saying building or compiling has been failed due to some technical or manual errors you have done in the code without knowing the idea that you are doing the errors.So, after the first time compilation you press enter little gently , the process goes on. Next time you compile again and see that repeats the same. Next time , same, this time you will loose little patience and press the enter 🔑 with applying

**Newtons third Law.**

For every action there is equal and opposite reaction .Thinking in that angle you press the enter with little hard ,repeats the situation of errors ,nest time more hard ….. Yes it works… Actually you corrected the errors and pressed the enter 🔑 , but for the viewers it looks as you pressed the enter 🔑 hard it listened your words . The more hard you press the enter 🔑 , the good will be the program output.

### Electricity Off 🔋

> *The ever green enemy of the programmer 💀💀*

You sat with the intention to complete all the bugs 🐞🐞 , that took life in your code. You thought of not getting up until the all the bugs killed and start to write the code. One hour passed ⌚ ⌚ . Your doing good with your code, still left some hidden bugs. Then you will see the notification on the screen Low Battery 🔋 power off shutting down the computer 💻 . The next thought you will get is to plug the charger 🔌. You have done a great job 👏 👏. After that you will see that power goes off . The electricity shuts down. No battery 🔋 No electricity ,No code. Regularly , after one hour or 30 min the power returns, but to our luck on that day you can’ t find that happened. You will wait like **👲 Boy friend waiting for kiss 💋 from his girl friend 👧** . The day will over and still no power,you keep on waiting for the few more hours ⌚ ⌚ and eventually the power comes. Then you will take a long breathe 💨 and opens your robot I means the machine where you start to code , the computer 💻 ,you do that with more excitement,after system 💻 gets on , then you go to the folder 📁 where your code lies. To your surprise 😮 😮 the edited files won’t exists . All the big mistake is,you forgot to save 💾 the files. That is the worst situation every programmer faces. Just you forget the pressing of **Ctrl + S** keys …… So make the habit of pressing those keys with out your knowledge.

### No Internet 🌏

The Internet is the Heart 💙 of programmer. I always go on search for the code syntax over the INTERNET . I helps to maintain the flow of the coding . So whenever you struck in coding certain logic,syntax info or functions of the object available , I always prefer the INTERNET. Here the situation comes. You are suppose to clear that bug in an hour, you done well with code logic, but a small syntax or parameters miss match occurs. As the code is free from the bugs 🐞 🐞 that raise at the time of compiling , you cannot figure out the actual error in the code , unless you run, Then you open your Google Chrome browser of Firefox or your choice of using one and see the **404** Server error . After looking that you feel like doing the repeated actions like reloading the page by hitting reloading icon with mouse 🐭 left click ⬅️ . you keep on pressing that over and over … of course you know that with out INTERNET that won’t possible , but we do that with more frustration.

### Code Cheating YOU 🙍

> *I know that you are a very good programmer, but be careful with your code.*

It is too dangerous in all aspects. Test that code in all possible ways you can. Then come to conclusion that your code works. Never accept the code that is less tested and unverified. That can make you to be fired from your boss.

On the pleasant day your boss comes and gives you a piece of work to complete by the evening . You will take that a challenge and you have done with the code. You feel like code works, then to get the applause 👏 👏from the boss , you will be excited to show the code to him. You asked the boss permission to enter in. He says “come in” . Until that moment everything went fine. He , the boss asks you to show the output, because they don’t care how you did, they only care the output. Now you will open the terminal and change the directory to the code folder and you will compile the code. Ya fine, the compiling has finished with no errors but few warnings.

I know the programmers never care for warnings, especially the C programmers. The boss says good go on. Now you run the code. Unexpectedly the ends with full of red letters in the terminal. What actually happened is you tested with individual threads but you forgot in testing the all the threads together, but you showed the boss what you should’t show. The immediate explanation is “sir, It worked few minutes back , I do not know why it is not working now “ . Then you can imagine the situation here. That is the most embarrassing moment where the programmer gets that unexpectedly..in surprise.

> **Never trust the code which is not TESTED**

If you have faced some other frustration which is uncommon to above ones comment below we receive with great honor.
