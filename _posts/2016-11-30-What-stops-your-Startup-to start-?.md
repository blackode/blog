> An Idea Can change your life, but do not change the life for stupid one.

In general, we make discussion over an IDEA that hits ones brain , sorry the ones intellectual brain whether is right or not. If you are doing this means stop this practice right at this moment.The IDEA itself is right, if you still feel the need to get confidence on your idea , I can say that it is no more and idea, but you can name it as a thought or simply a phrase if it is more worse. The outcome of the multiple thoughts from the single brain is the Idea. Brain should be one and It should be unique in thoughts. So, **never ever make discussion over an Idea. If you do so, that resembles nothing more than self bitin**g.

### Over Assumptions

> The best assumption in the life that you ever think is reading other minds.

**Assumptions are the crystals that shine in mind of every member of the discussion**. We really do not know what really it matters to or what it really matter in the product we build, but we start thinking out of the box about the problems we encounter in the process of building. We have not yet started the process but we keep on thinking how to face those problems. First you start, then if you really get the problems in the journey of your product building, then that is the right time to sit together have a drink of solutions.

### Ideal Brain

> Rule your brain to rule the other ones.

Too many hands spoil the work. **Never ever shake hand about your idea with the third eye or second brain**. If you do so,that going to the be the first fall of your individuality . If you really want to taste the fruit of your idea, stop listening to others, just ask them to assist on your idea. Plan should come from one brain who had the clear picture. The rest should be mute. If you are taking the advice from others ,that resembles you are not unique. People stops following you and starts judging you . **Stick to the idea, no matters what it costs.**

### Money as factor of Discussion

> Lack of Funding is not a problem , that just increase your success story or add few lines when some one writes your.

I know that money is the major problem for many startups, for some startups that will be the only problem. But trust me , **the money may be the problem but that do not stay as a problem always**. Once you succeed in the field that you are interested, the money will be word you talking in less count after all in your career or to the surprise in life. You keep on thinking about how to create the creative things that which brings you the fame and name together in chain. Instead of suffering for gaining the money , you better to keep yourself to work on gaining the ones trust, that is the only measuring unit for the ones success. **Stop acting and stay as you**. Pretending may bring you for that moment,but it lasts for a moment. It cannot travel with you. Fame stays even after you die. **Just gain one person who remembers your name and deeds.**
